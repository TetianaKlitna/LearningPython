# corr koef - relation between 2 variables [-1; 1] - strength of relationship
# 1- strong relationship, 0.75 data more spread out, but also good corr, 0.56 - moderate corr(medium)
# 0.21 (week corr), 0.04 - no relationship
# + - x increases and y increases
# - x increases and y decreases
# x corr y = y corr x 
# corr cannot be 0 !
# diffrenet variation to calc corr, example  Pearson product-moment corr (r)
# visual scatter plot, or bar distribution data - - can apply log when  corr!!! corr only for linear relations
#Transformations help to do relation more linear:
# log , sqrt, 1/x
# Combination: log(x) and log(y); sqrt(x) and 1/y
# Correlation  is not imply  Causation x corr y NOT x causes y
# spurious corr!

#Controlled(random) and observational(smoke or not smoke)

#Cross-sectional studies are observational studies that analyze data from a population at a single point in time.
#Longitudinal studies employ continuous or repeated measures to follow particular individuals over prolonged periods of timeâ€”often years or decades.
